<h3 align="center">Mount: MattaScope Endoscope Mount </h3>

  <p align="center">
    This is a simple, one-piece mount to allow a cheap, off-the-shelf endoscope to work as a nozzle camera for a range of Creality Printers (Ender 3 for sure - need to test on others)

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Installation ‚ö°Ô∏è

Mount installation is simple - requiring no other components or tools! We recommend printing in ASA, to give better thermal resistance, but PLA also works.

<p>
  <b>Slicing/Printing</b>

  1. Slice with normal or tree supports, with the cable holder flat against the bed.

  2. We usually recommend a layer height of 0.2mm, and a brim for bed adhesion.
  <br>
  3. Print in ASA for longevity, but PLA works fine also.
  <br />
  <br />
</p>
<p>
  <b>Installation</b>

  1. Clip the endoscope into the mount, and secure the cable by pushing it into the clasp.

  2. Locate the right-hand belt holder behind the extruder head

  3. Carefully push the mount onto the belt holder - until the back wall of the mounting clip is fully underneath the X-axis extrusion.

  <br />
</p>

If used with the recommended endoscope, we have found the optimum focus value to be 530.

Set this with ```sudo v4l2-ctl --set-ctrl focus_automatic_continuous=0``` & 
```sudo v4l2-ctl --set-ctrl focus_absolute=530```

<br/>

If using a Raspberry Pi, you can ensure these commands run on boot, and therefore are saved by adding these two lines to ```/etc/rc.local``` with ```sudo nano /etc/rc.local``` from root.
